## ðŸ‘‹  Hi there 

<p>
Starting with a double degree, Business-Engineer, to become DataViz Manager for Big Data at SocGen and self-entrepreneur. Today I'm currently working on an entrepreneurship project about data and automation. 

Passionate about management and innovation with an interest in IT. The impact of the user experience on customers is at the heart of my concerns.

WAOS"s goal is to simplify the **start** of new **tech projects** / **startups**. As we know It must be **fast**, **efficient** while **avoiding the refactor** afterward.
